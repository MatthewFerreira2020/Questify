Planner that allows you to set tasks for the week. Each task is assigned a location using gps and you can't say you 
completed the task without being there. Upon completion you're shown a visual representation of your progress. Once you complete
your weekly goals you gain a level, if you fail to complete them you lose a level. What makes this app different from other
planners is the rpg aspect where by completing tasks you level up your buddy and unlock new cosmetic upgrades. You can
compare with friends to see how productive and consistent you are at completing goals using the leaderboard.

### Value for Users

The app helps the user remember to complete weekly tasks and stay on track to finish longer goals like working out more. 
Location tracking discourages lying about completing tasks and will motivate the user to finish tasks. RPG elements
also motivate users to continue finishing tasks to level up and unlock new cosmetics.

### Use Cases

User trying to stay on track with fitness goals could set tasks each week for things like going to the gym and completing
runs. At the start of the week they would add their goals and each time they went to the gym they would add progress to
completing that task. Over time they would gain levels while reaching their fitness goals.

A kid could keep track of their weekly chores. They would be able to easily check what still needs to be done and update it as
the week progresses. At the end of the week they would gain a level and would be able to customize their buddy over time.
